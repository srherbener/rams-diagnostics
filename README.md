# rams-diagnostics
This repository contains FORTRAN programs and scripts in various languages (bash, MATLAB, Python, Perl).
This software is used for analyzing the output of RAMS (Regional Atmospheric Modeling System), or REVU which is
the dataset extractor for RAMS.

For example, the FORTRAN program azavg will do azimuthal averaging of atmospheric quantities in simulated tropical cyclones.
