# There seems to be an issue with enscript/lp/lpr printing to lion with the duplex
# mode enabled. When duplex is enabled the job gets stuck waiting for the manual paper
# feed (tray 1) to get loaded. When duplex mode is disabled, then the job goes to tray 2
# and does not get stuck.
#
# I've tried many things to get the job to go to tray 2 but no success. The only thing
# that seems to be paid attention to is whether or not duplex mode is enabled.
#
# For this reason direct the output to zebra instead.
